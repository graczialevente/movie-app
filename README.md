# Movie app

Using the search api provided by tmdb, I created a responsive web application that caches the received response. It displays the result in a pageable form on the frontend.

## About this project

This project is an experiment for me to see how to solve this problem with  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and server components.

- Redis used for caching
- Tailwind for the styles
- Yup schema validation for internal search API endpoint
